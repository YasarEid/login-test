# Selenium End-to-End Automation Test

Welcome! This project uses Selenium with Python to automate end-to-end tests for the login functionality on [Practice Test Automation](https://practicetestautomation.com/practice-test-login/). The tests follow the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern to keep the code clean and easy to maintain.

---

## What This Project Does

The test suite covers these scenarios:

1. Logging in with **valid** username and password  
2. Trying to log in with **invalid** credentials and capturing the error message  
3. Checking if the **logout button** or success message appears after logging in  
4. Trying to access a **protected page** without logging in  
5. Logging out and verifying that the session ends properly  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**  
- **Selenium WebDriver** for browser automation  
- **Pytest** as the testing framework  
- **webdriver-manager** for managing browser drivers automatically  
- **python-dotenv** to handle environment variables (like URLs)  
- Following the **Page Object Model (POM)** to organize the code

## 🔐 Setting Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the project root with these URLs:

```env
BASE_URL=https://practicetestautomation.com
```

---

## 📦 How to Get Started

1. Clone this repo to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YasarEid/login-test.git
cd login-test
```

2. Install the needed Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create your `.env` file as explained above.

---

## 🚀 Running the Tests

Simply run:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Pytest will pick up and run all the test cases in the `tests/` folder.

## 🔍 Tests Included

| Test Case                           | What it does                                     |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Valid Login                         | Logs in successfully with correct credentials    |
| Invalid Username                    | Tries to log in with wrong username               |
| Invalid Password                    | Tries to log in with wrong password               |
| Access Protected Page Without Login | Tries to open success page without logging in   |
| Logout                              | Logs out and verifies session is closed          |

## 💡 Why This Approach?

- Using **Page Object Model (POM)** makes tests easier to read and maintain  
- Explicit waits ensure tests wait for page elements to load properly  
- Using environment variables keeps config clean and flexible  
- Writing tests with **pytest** allows for modular, readable test code
